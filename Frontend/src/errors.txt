=> CSSTransition , TypeError: import_react_dom.default.findDOMNode is not a function

==>That error means you're likely using CSSTransition without providing a nodeRef, and under the hood it's trying to call findDOMNode â€” which has been removed in React 19.
Why this happens:
CSSTransition used to rely on ReactDOM.findDOMNode() to access the DOM node of its child. But since React 18+ (especially React 19), findDOMNode is deprecated and now completely removed, so any component that still tries to use it will throw a TypeError.
âœ… How to fix it:
Use the nodeRef prop and pass a ref to the DOM element you're animating. Here's how to update your code:
ðŸ”§ Updated Example:
import { CSSTransition } from 'react-transition-group';
import { useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ show }) {
  const nodeRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <CSSTransition
      in={show}
      timeout={200}
      classNames="slide-in-left"
      mountOnEnter
      unmountOnExit
      nodeRef={nodeRef} // ðŸ‘ˆ This avoids findDOMNode
    >
      <div ref={nodeRef}>Hello, I slide in!</div>
    </CSSTransition>
  );
}

Make sure the ref is attached directly to the DOM node (like a <div> or <button>), not a custom component.

If you're using a third-party component inside CSSTransition that doesnâ€™t forward refs properly, that could still break things. In that case, you might need to:
- Wrap the component in a native element (like a <div>)
- Or switch to a library that supports React 19
Let me know what you're animating â€” I can help tailor the fix.
